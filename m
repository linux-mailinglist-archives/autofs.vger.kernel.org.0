Dear Beneficiary,

This message is directed to inform you that the Department of the fund
recovery has investigated your fund, which has been on transfer process
for some period of time. During the second quarter of the Bernard Arnault
Foundation, the recovery unit has recovered your fund at the tune of ZAR
I, 000,000.00 (One Million Rand), which was to be paid to you as the
beneficiary.

And it has been understood by our investigating team that this fund was
acquired by you as a result of the initial inheritance of the fund, which
your partner was supposed to remit the fund into your bank account some
past years. After the auditing, the recovery unit decides that the entire
recovered and returned fund should be paid to the beneficiary owners
within 2 weeks. This decision was taken by the Board of the auditors in
the recovery department, and at present the fund is in the escrow account.

The recovery unit has approved the release of your fund, and it has also
decided that your fund should be transferred to you without any further
delay. For your full identification and authorization of your payment, you
are hereby advised to send to our approval department/manager your full
information as stated below:

1. Full Name:
2. Your Alternative Email:
3. Country:
4. Contact Telephone Number:

Please email the below manager with all your information details regarding
these developments to enable us to proceed.

Mr. James Morgan
Phone: +27 60 420 2455
N/B: Please reply directly to this email address: manager@workmail.co.za

We wait for your urgent responds before the end of today.

Yours sincerely,
Ms. Delphine Arnault
Secretary General (Bernard Arnault Foundation)
