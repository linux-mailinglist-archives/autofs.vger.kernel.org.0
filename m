FYI, as a third option/way, one thing we do is that we bind the root of
direct automount maps into containers (though we're using singularity)
and the automount bits continue to work just fine inside and out of said
containers.  We have not noticed any big issues with expirations not
happening, at least that we can contribute specifically to the container
use in these cases.

Note that singularity seems to understand autofs mount points though,
and if started with debug it walks and loads the direct map into its
internal /proc/mounts, which is probably why it works so well.  Now that
I think of it, I have no idea if it continues to work with any paths
added after the container starts though since it wouldn't have been
there when starting and might not be seen as a trigger.
