Please I am writing to notify you again on my intention to list your
name as a beneficiary to the total sum of GBP6.350 million (Six
million, Three hundred and fifty thousand British Pounds Sterlings) in
the intent of the deceased (name now withheld since this is my second
letter to you).

I contacted you because you bear the surname identity and therefore
can present you as the beneficiary to inherit the account proceeds of
the deceased since there is no written "WILL" or trace to the deceased
family relatives. My aim is to present you to my Bank Authorities as
the Next of Kin to our deceased client. I will guide you all through
the Claim procedure by providing all relevant Information and guiding
you in your decisions and response to the Bank Management. All the
papers will be processed after your acceptance.

In your acceptance of this deal, I request that you kindly forward to
me your letter of acceptance; your current telephone and fax numbers
,age, occupational status and a forwarding address to enable me submit
to the Bank Management the details as the Next of Kin to their
deceased customer. Reply strictly through: ramcharancrdavid@gmail.com

Yours faithfully,
Cr.David Ramcharan
